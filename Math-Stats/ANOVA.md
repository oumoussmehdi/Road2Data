# ANOVA: Analysis of Variance 

SST: total sum of squares
ground mean = mean of the means of each group

m*n members
m*n-1 degree of freedom

sst/degree-freedom = variance of the total group 

ssw : total sum of squares within
ssw = 
df = m*(n-1)

ssb :  total sum of squares between 
how much of the total var is due to the variation between the means from each sample and the ground mean
df = m-1

degree of freedom: if you know the mean you can figure out the nth element (n-1)


# Hypothesis test with F-statistic

H0 : no difference (means all equals)

H1 : 

alpha = .10 (significance level)
F-stat = [ssb/(m-1)]/[ssw/(m*(n-1))]
is a ratio of 2 chi distributions
