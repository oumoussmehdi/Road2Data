## Parametric Tests:

* (independent-samples) t-tests
* (paired-samples) t-test
* (One-way) Anova

Assumptions:
- random independent samples
- interval or ratio level measuremnet 
- normally distributed
- no outliers
- homogeneity of variance
- sample sizes larger than minimum for many nonparam tests

more powerful compared to non-param tests - more likely to detect a difference that truly exists
less likely than nonparam tests to make type II error


## Non-Parametric Tests : 

* Mann-whitney test
* Wilcoxon signed-rank test
* Kruskal-Wallis Test

### Assumptions
- random indep samples
- mann-whitney test : two samples that have the same shape
- wilcoxon signer-rank test : symmetric distribution
- Kruskal-Wallis and Friedman's Anova : same shape and equal variance 

- more conservative
- less statistical power 
- more likely to produce a type II erro
