The below criteria should be used to select and rank various acceptable model options:

- Accuracy: the model’s accuracy in measuring signal
- Completeness: the degree to which the model captures the signal in the data
- Performance: the speed and scalability of the underlying algorithms
- Ease of deployment: the amount of resources and time needed to build the model and put it in production
- Automation: the degree to which the model automates the task in question
- Explicability: the level of the model’s causal simplicity and traceability
- Stakeholder value: the level of value added by the model’s use. (Profit Curve is a helpful way of handling stakeholder value for classification problems.)



- Model explainability
- Model transparency
- Model stability (sensitivity analysis)
- Model degradation (in data-streams)

In case if extreme skewed datasets, accuracy is not a good indicator
