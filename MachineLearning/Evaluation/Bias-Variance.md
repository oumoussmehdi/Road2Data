## Bias 
bias is the difference between the average prediction of a model and the correct value which we are trying to predict.
bias is an error from erroneous assumptions in the learning algorithm.

high bias : causes an algo to miss the relevant relations between features and target outputs  (underfitting)

## Variance 
variance is an error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set

high variance: causes an algo to model the random noise in the training set rather than the intended ouputs (overfitting)

bias-variance decomposition : 
total error = bias^2 + variance + irreducible error


## Bias-Variance Tradeoff

- If our model is too simple and has very few parameters then it may have high bias and low variance
- if our model has large number of parameters then itâ€™s going to have high variance and low bias
