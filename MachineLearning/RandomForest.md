hyper-params tuning :
- n_estimators = number of trees in the foreset
- max_features = max number of features considered for splitting a node
- max_depth = max number of levels in each decision tree
- min_samples_split = min number of data points placed in a node before the node is split
- min_samples_leaf = min number of data points allowed in a leaf node
- bootstrap = method for sampling data points (with or without replacement)
