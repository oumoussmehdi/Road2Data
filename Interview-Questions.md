What is classifier in machine learning?
A classifier in a Machine Learning is a system that inputs a vector of discrete or continuous feature values and outputs a single discrete value, the class

What is ‘Overfitting’ in Machine learning?
In machine learning, when a statistical model describes random error or noise instead of underlying relationship ‘overfitting’ occurs.

Explain what is the function of ‘Unsupervised Learning’?
a)      Find clusters of the data
b)      Find low-dimensional representations of the data
c)       Find interesting directions in data
d)      Interesting coordinates and correlations
e)      Find novel observations/ database cleaning

What is Model Selection in Machine Learning?
The process of selecting models among different mathematical models, which are used to describe the same data set is known as Model Selection.


What are the two methods used for the calibration in Supervised Learning?
The two methods used for predicting good probabilities in Supervised Learning are
a)      Platt Calibration
b)      Isotonic Regression
These methods are designed for binary classification, and it is not trivial.

What is Perceptron in Machine Learning?
In Machine Learning, Perceptron is an algorithm for supervised classification of the input into one of several possible non-binary outputs

What is bias-variance decomposition of classification error in ensemble method?
The expected error of a learning algorithm can be decomposed into bias and variance. A bias term measures how closely the average classifier produced by the learning algorithm matches the target function.  The variance term measures how much the learning algorithm’s prediction fluctuates for different training sets.

What is an Incremental Learning algorithm in ensemble?
Incremental learning method is the ability of an algorithm to learn from new data that may be available after classifier has already been generated from already available dataset.

What is PCA, KPCA and ICA used for?
PCA (Principal Components Analysis), 
KPCA ( Kernel based Principal Component Analysis) 
ICA ( Independent Component Analysis) 
are important feature extraction techniques used for dimensionality reduction.

What are the different methods for Sequential Supervised Learning?

The different methods to solve Sequential Supervised Learning problems are
a)      Sliding-window methods
b)      Recurrent sliding windows
c)       Hidden Markow models
d)      Maximum entropy Markow models
e)      Conditional random fields
f)       Graph transformer networks
